Project Name:
Leo's Mews


Project Description: 
The project is based on a video of a cat who is leaving for college to NYUAD. The movie and website is targeted towards cat enthusiasts.
the theme i tried to go for was a wholesome one. 




Process: 
the website is very simplistic in design. I wanted the viewers to see the trailer as soon as they visited the website. 
they also have the option to get to know the cast better and there is also a gallery section for cat entusiasts. 


Reflection/Evaluation:I found javascript and css to be very be very challenging. i changed the initial layout of my website because i 
could not figure out how to implement certain ideas.
